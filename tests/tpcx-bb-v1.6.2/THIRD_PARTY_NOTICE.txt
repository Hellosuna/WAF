A number of Big Data Benchmark for BigBench Specification queries are derived from TPC-DS and as such are not comparable to a published TPC-DS result.

This kit contains a restricted version of the Parallel Data Generation Framework (PDGF), which is used to generate the benchmark data set. PDGF is a product of bankmark UG (haftungsbeschraenkt). License terms for PDGF can be found in the data-generator directory. See
   data-generator/LICENSE.txt

This kit redistributes the Apache 2 licensed OpenNLP (https://opennlp.apache.org/) ingredients opennlp-maxent-3.0.3.jar and opennlp-tools-1.9.3.jar that are unmodified distributions of these versions acquired in binary form from the maven mirror.  See

At compile time, this kit requires several Apache projects that provide API import bindings for ingredients provided by Hadoop implementations.  These libraries are not restributed with TPCx-BB but we enumerate them here for completeness.  All of these are Apache 2 licensed (distributions/Resources/LICENSE).
   org.apache.commons.cli (v1.2)
   org.apache.log4j (v1.2)
   org.apache.spark (v2.4/v2.1/2.3/1.6)
   org.apache.hive (v3.1/2.1/2.3/1.1)
   org.apache.hadoop (v3.1/2.6)
   com.hortonworks.hwc (v1.0)

In addition, the benchmark bases a few file handling code templates on org.apache.hadoop samples.  These are annotated in src/HadoopClusterExec_src.jar at io/bigdatabenchmark/hadoop/HadoopClusterExec.java.  These samples are Apache 2 licensed (distributions/Resources/LICENSE)
